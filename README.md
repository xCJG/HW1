Which K(1-20) is works the best? If the K have similar accuracy, explain why?

K11-20 all work the best and similarly becasue they have the highest accuracy of 1.00

There is a reason for the similar accuracy values, the iris dataset's simplicity and clear separation among classes contribute to similar accuracy across various kk values in KNN
